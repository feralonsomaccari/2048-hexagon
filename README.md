I had a lot of fun with this project and definitely learned a lot from it; Specially about the hexagonal topic which was something new for me and made me want to dive into different concepts and algorithms. The [cube coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-cube) was a nice reading.
